[**Frogger**](https://www.neozl24.cn/frogger/) is an improved version of the original Konami arcade game 'Frogger'. The goal is to avoid obstacles (including bugs) while moving your character towards the opposite side of the river (towards the top of the screen). The more rivers you cross, the more scores you will be rewarded, and the higher you will be ranked on the world rankings.
